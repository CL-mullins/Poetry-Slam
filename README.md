TODO: Copy Ocean Vuong's "Someday I'll Love Ocean Vuong" into a textfile for parsing

**********IMPORTANT**********
This program utilizes the 'encoding' functionality only available in Python 3. If you are having difficulites running the code, example: TypeError: 'encoding' is an invalid keyword argument for this function, try using the command:

$ Python 3 main.py

In terminal. Omit '$' if "command not found " error occurs

*********UPDATE*************
Code fully operational.

This python script will output lines from a poem read by the interpreter. There are 3 other functions that print out the same lines from .txt file

1. lines_printed_backwards()
    prints the lines from the .txt in a backwards order with each line from the poem being numbered in forwards order.

2. lines_printed_random()
    prints all random lines of the poem until there are equally as many lines as there are in the poem

3. lines_printed_custom()
    prints lines from the code that fit certain qualifications, in this case, the qualifications are whenever the poet mentions his own name, or references his father or mother.
